This changelog is gonna be a bit more technical than usual, but I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. But this is probably not interesting for most of you, so feel free to skip this one.

## Complete rewrite

We've rewritten the entire app from scratch. This means that we've started from a blank slate and built everything up again. This was necessary to make the app more maintainable and to make it easier to add new features in the future.

It also makes the app more future proof as we went from NextJS pages router to the new app router. We also structured the app in a way that we can build the mobile app alongside the current api.

## Out with the old, in with the new

This new version of the app is much faster and target-user focused. We have removed our landing page and now directly take you to the feed. And we have made our PWA use much more of the native features of your device such as sharing.
