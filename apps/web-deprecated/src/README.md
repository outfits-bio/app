# 🌐 Source Code Directory (`src/`)

Welcome to the `src/` directory of outfits.bio! Here's a quick guide to what you'll find in each sub-directory and the conventions we follow. 🗺️

## 🏗️ `components/`

This is where we keep all our React components. Each component is named with the `Component.tsx` format. If a component is reusable, you'll find it here!

## 🎣 `hooks/`

Our custom React hooks reside in this directory. They follow the `file.hook.tsx` format. Hooks are a great way to extract component logic into reusable functions!

## 📄 `pages/`

Welcome to the routes of our Next.js application! Every file in this directory (or in nested directories) becomes an accessible route. Files follow the `page.tsx` format.

## 📋 `schemas/`

Zod schemas live here. These are for form validation, data validation, etc. Each schema file follows the `file.schema.ts`.

## 🌐 `server/api/routers/`

This directory contains tRPC routers for creating a type-safe API. Each router file follows the `file.ts` format.

## 🔧 `server/utils/`

Need a utility function just for the server or API? You'll find it here. Each utility file follows the `file.util.ts` format.

## 🎨 `styles/`

This directory houses all our CSS styles. Each file uses the `file.css` format. We're using Tailwind CSS for styling - it's fantastic!

## 🛠️ `utils/`

Finally, this is the home for utility functions used across the web app, both server and client-side. Each utility file follows the `file.util.ts` format.

Remember, our code is like a garden - we want to keep it clean, well-organized, and easy to navigate. Happy coding! 🌷🌼🌸
