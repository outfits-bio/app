# August 2, 2024 - Feed redesign

## Feed now has a completely new look-and-feel

Starting today the new more tiktok-like feed is live. This means that you can now swipe through posts and double click to like. Interacting with the post is now aligned to the right side of the post on both mobile and desktop.

On desktop suggested profiles are now shown on the right side of the feed. This way you can easily find new people to follow. On mobile it is accessible from the search page.
